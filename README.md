<h1>👋 Hi, I’m Hossein Nazari (@Hossein-Nazari-Dev)</h1>
<p>🏛️ A Master’s graduate in Sustainable Architecture with a passion for merging technology, design, and sustainability.</p>
<p>👀 I’m deeply interested in building science, computational geometry, evidence-based design, energy efficiency, and the development of digital tools that empower architects and designers to create sustainable buildings, products, and cities.</p>
<p>🌱 I’m currently exploring machine learning, optimization, agent-based modeling, and the development of social digital twins to revolutionize how we approach sustainable design and urban planning.</p>
<p>💡 I’m the founder of NexoNest, a startup focused on creating innovative tools that enable architects and designers to design more sustainable and efficient structures. My work bridges the gap between architecture, technology, and sustainability.</p>
<p>💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects related to:
<ul>
        <li>Building, Cities and Produc design with Computational Approach</li>
        <li>Sustainable design tool</li>
        <li>Digital twins (especially social ones)</li>
        <li>Agent-based modeling</li>
        <li>Machine learning and optimization in architecture</li>
        <li>Energy-efficient building solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>💻 I code in Python and C#, leveraging these languages to develop computational tools, simulations, and data-driven solutions for the architecture and design industries.</p>
<p>📫 How to reach me: <a href="mailto:hossein.nazari.ac@gmail.com">Just Email Me</a> I will be so happy! </p>

<p>😄 Pronouns: He/Him</p>
<p> ⚡ <b>Fun fact: I once developed a computational design tool in 48 hours during a hackathon, which later became the foundation for one of NexoNest’s core products! </b></p>
