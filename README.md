<p>👋 Hi, I’m Hossein Nazari (@Hossein-Nazari-Dev)</p>
🏛️ A Master’s graduate in Sustainable Architecture with a passion for merging technology, design, and sustainability.
👀 I’m deeply interested in building science, computational geometry, evidence-based design, energy efficiency, and the development of digital tools that empower architects and designers to create sustainable buildings, products, and cities.
🌱 I’m currently exploring machine learning, optimization, agent-based modeling, and the development of social digital twins to revolutionize how we approach sustainable design and urban planning.
💡 I’m the founder of NexoNest, a startup focused on creating innovative tools that enable architects and designers to design more sustainable and efficient structures. My work bridges the gap between architecture, technology, and sustainability.
💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects related to:
        Sustainable design tool
        Digital twins (especially social ones)
        Agent-based modeling
        Machine learning and optimization in architecture
        Energy-efficient building solutions

💻 I code in Python and C#, leveraging these languages to develop computational tools, simulations, and data-driven solutions for the architecture and design industries.
