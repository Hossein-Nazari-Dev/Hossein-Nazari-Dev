<h1 style = "font-size : 1em">👋 Hi, I’m Hossein Nazari (@Hossein-Nazari-Dev)</h1>
<p>🏛️ A Master’s graduate in <u>Sustainable Architecture</u> with a passion for merging technology, design, and sustainability.</p>
<p>👀 I’m deeply interested in <u>building science, computational geometry, evidence-based design, energy efficiency</u>, and the <u>development of digital tools</u> that empower architects and designers to create sustainable buildings, products, and cities.</p>
<p>🌱 I’m currently exploring <u>machine learning, optimization, agent-based modeling</u>, and the <u>development of social digital twins</u> to revolutionize how we approach sustainable design and urban planning.</p>
<p>💡💡 I’m the founder of <b><a href="https://www.NexoNest.com">NexoNest</a></b> , a startup focused on creating innovative tools that enable architects and designers to <u>design more sustainable and efficient structures.</u></p>
<h2>I’m open to collaborating on projects related to:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>Building, Cities and Produc design with Computational Approach</li>
        <li>Sustainable design tool</li>
        <li>Digital twins (especially social ones)</li>
        <li>Agent-based modeling</li>
        <li>Machine learning and optimization in architecture</li>
        <li>Energy-efficient building solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>💻 I code in Python and C#, leveraging these languages to develop computational tools, simulations, and data-driven solutions for the architecture and design industries.</p>
<p>📫 How to reach me: <a href="mailto:hossein.nazari.ac@gmail.com">Just Email Me</a> I will be so happy! </p>
